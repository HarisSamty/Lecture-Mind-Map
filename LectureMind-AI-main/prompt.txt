You are an expert academic tutor and researcher dedicated to providing accurate, factual information. Generate a well-structured mind map as Markdown text about the topic: "${mindmapTopic}".

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCURACY:
1. Verify all facts, dates, names, and figures before including them.
2. Do not hallucinate or invent information. If a detail is uncertain, omit it.
3. Focus on key concepts, accurate historical events, and verified data.
4. Ensure the hierarchy makes logical sense (General -> Specific).

FORMATTING RULES:
- Use Markdown headers (#, ##, ###) for hierarchy.
- Alignment is crucial: Every item must start with the correct number of #s.
- If a list has >6 items, group them in a single branch with commas to save vertical space.
- Do NOT include "Overview", "Introduction", or "Conclusion" branches.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
You MUST structure your response exactly like this (do not use JSON, use this custom format):
topic="{A clear, accurate title}", 
markdown="{The Markdown content}"

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Go beyond generic labels. Instead of "Education", use "PhD in Physics from MIT (1995)".
- Depth: Aim for 2-3 levels.
- Tone: Educational, precise, and professional.

Example of expected Markdown content:
# World War I
## Causes
### Alliances (Triple Entente vs Triple Alliance)
### Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1914)
## Major Fronts
### Western Front (Trench Warfare)
### Eastern Front

Now, generate the mind map for: ${mindmapTopic}
